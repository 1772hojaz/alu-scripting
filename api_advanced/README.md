FRONTEND PROGRAMMING
Front-end programming refers to the development of the visual and interactive components of a website or application that users see and interact with. 
It involves using front-end programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the layout, design, and functionality of a website or application. 
Front-end developers are responsible for ensuring that the website or application is easy to navigate and intuitive for the user.
They work closely with back-end developers who use back-end programming languages to fulfill user requests on the server side.
Front-end development is a constantly evolving field that requires creativity, problem-solving skills, and a willingness to learn new technologies
