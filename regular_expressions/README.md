Regular expressions, or regex, are sequences of characters that specify a match pattern in text. They are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation

Regex can be used in a wide variety of text processing tasks, and more generally string processing, where the data need not be textual

There are several online tools available to learn, build, test, and debug regex, such as RegExr regex101 and RexEgg

Microsoft Learn also provides a quick reference for the .NET Regular Expression Language

Regular-Expressions.info offers a comprehensive tutorial that explains the regex syntax and describes in detail how the regex engine actually goes about its work
